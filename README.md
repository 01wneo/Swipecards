Swipecards
==========

A Tinder-like cards effect as of August 2014. You can swipe left or right to like or dislike the content.


---

The library creates a similar effect to Tinder's swipable cards with Fling animation.

It was inspired by kikoso's https://github.com/kikoso/Swipeable-Cards but I decided to create a more simple and fresh approach.
